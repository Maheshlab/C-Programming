# C Programming Language

Welcome to the **C Programming** repository! This repository is a beginner-friendly guide to learning the C language, including its rich history, fundamental concepts, and powerful features.

## 📜 History of C Programming

- **Created By:** Dennis Ritchie
- **Developed At:** Bell Labs (AT&T)
- **Year of Creation:** 1972
- **Based On:** B and BCPL languages

The C programming language was developed to implement the UNIX operating system, which was originally written in assembly. It provided low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, which made it ideal for system programming.

Over the years, C has become one of the most widely used programming languages, influencing many others including C++, C#, Java, and Objective-C.

## 🚀 Features of C

- ✅ **Simple and Efficient:** Minimalistic language with a small set of keywords and powerful operators.
- 🧠 **Low-Level Access:** Direct access to memory using pointers, suitable for system-level programming.
- 🧱 **Modular:** Code can be divided into functions for better organization and reusability.
- 💻 **Fast Execution:** Due to its closeness to assembly and minimal overhead.
- 🌐 **Portable:** Programs written in C can be run on different machines with little or no modification.
- 🔧 **Rich Library Support:** Standard C Library provides a wide range of built-in functions.
- 📦 **Structured Programming Language:** Encourages a disciplined programming style using control flow (if, else, loops, switch).
- 🧩 **Extensible:** Supports the development of complex applications using custom libraries and functions.
